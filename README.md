## Code Auto-completion
Stubs have been created with [ironstubs](https://github.com/gtalarico/ironpython-stubs) to enable code auto-completion.

To enable this feature, [configure your editor](https://github.com/gtalarico/ironpython-stubs/wiki) to use the stubs located in the [stubs](https://github.com/NISystemsEngineering/rfmx-pythonnet/tree/master/stubs/) directory.

If you are using Visual Studio Code, a [settings file](https://github.com/NISystemsEngineering/rfmx-pythonnet/tree/master/.vscode) has already been provided. To use it, clone this repo then open the folder in VS Code. 

Note: The stubs require some additional modifications in order to expose all auto-complete options. Note that not all options will be available, especially as new versions are released. Always refer to the product documentation for a complete list of functionality.
