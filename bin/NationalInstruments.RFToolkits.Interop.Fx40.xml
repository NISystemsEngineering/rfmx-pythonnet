             If you set the NIWLANA_RECOMMENDED_ACQUISITION_TYPE attribute to NIWLANA_VAL_ACQUISITION_TYPE_IQ:The niWLANA_RFSAMeasure function calls the niRFSA_Initiate function in case of single device, or niWLANA_RFSAMultipleDeviceInitiate function in case of multiple devices for data acquisition.
             The niWLANA_RFSAMeasure function fetches the data by calling the niRFSA_FetchIQ and performs the measurements by calling the niWLANA_AnalyzeIQComplexF64 or niWLANA_AnalyzeMIMOIQComplexF64 functions. The niWLANA_RFSAMeasure function repeats this step till the averaging is done for the recommended number of records.

             Purpose
             Performs I/Q measurements or spectral measurements, or both. This function configures and initiates the NI-RFSAs for acquisition and then performs the configured WLAN measurements on the acquired data using the niWLANA_AnalyzeIQComplexF64, niWLANA_AnalyzeMIMOIQComplexF64, niWLANA_AnalyzePowerSpectrum, or niWLANA_AnalyzeMIMOPowerSpectrum function.
             The niWLANA_RFSAMeasure function does the following steps:
             Configures NI-RFSA for IQ or Spectrum acquisitions depending on the type of WLAN measurements, by calling the niWLANA_RFSAConfigureHardware function. For multiple devices functions are called in a loop. 
             If you set the NIWLANA_RECOMMENDED_ACQUISITION_TYPE attribute to NIWLANA_VAL_ACQUISITION_TYPE_IQ:The niWLANA_RFSAMeasure function calls the niRFSA_Initiate function in case of single device, or niWLANA_RFSAMultipleDeviceInitiate function in case of multiple devices for data acquisition.
             The niWLANA_RFSAMeasure function fetches the data by calling the niRFSA_FetchIQ and performs the measurements by calling the niWLANA_AnalyzeIQComplexF64 or niWLANA_AnalyzeMIMOIQComplexF64 functions. The niWLANA_RFSAMeasure function repeats this step till the averaging is done for the recommended number of records. 
             If you set the NIWLANA_RECOMMENDED_ACQUISITION_TYPE attribute to NIWLANA_VAL_ACQUISITION_TYPE_SPECTRUM:
             The niWLANA_RFSAMeasure function calls the niRFSA_ReadPowerSpectrum function if you set the NIWLANA_GATED_SPECTRUM_ENABLED attribute to NIWLANA_VAL_FALSE or calls the niWLANA_RFSAReadGatedPowerSpectrum function if you set the NIWLANA_GATED_SPECTRUM_ENABLED attribute to NIWLANA_VAL_TRUE, to get the averaged power spectrum data.
             The niWLANA_RFSAMeasure function performs spectral measurements by calling the niWLANA_AnalyzePowerSpectrum or niWLANA_AnalyzeMIMOPowerSpectrum functions.
             The niWLANA_RFSAMeasure function calls the niRFSA_Abort function to stop any further acquisitions initiated earlier.

                You can use this measurement to verify that the device under test (DUT) conforms to section 17.3.9.1 of IEEE Standard 802.11a-1999,    section 18.4.7.1 of IEEE Standard 802.11b-1999, or section 20.3.21.3 of IEEE Standard 802.11n-2009, all of which specify maximum    output power in certain cases. This value is expressed in mW. 
                Use the following equation to convert from dBm to mW: 1 mW=10^(1 dBm/10)
                If you set the NIWLANA_STANDARD attribute    to NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211AG_OFDM, NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211J_OFDM,    NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211P_OFDM, NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211BG_DSSS, or NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211G_DSSS_OFDM, you    must use an empty string to query this attribute. 
                If you set the NIWLANA_STANDARD attribute to NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211N_MIMO_OFDM or    NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211AH_MIMO_OFDM, you must    use 'channelx' as the active channel string format to query this attribute.
                If you set the NIWLANA_STANDARD attribute    to NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211AC_MIMO_OFDM, NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211AF_MIMO_OFDM or NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211AX_MIMO_OFDM, you must    use '[segmentx/]channely' as the active channel string format to query this attribute. 'segment0/' is optional if    the NIWLANA_NUMBER_OF_SEGMENTS attribute is set to 1.
                If you set the NIWLANA_STANDARD attribute    to NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211AC_MIMO_OFDM, NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211AF_MIMO_OFDM or NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211AX_MIMO_OFDM, you must    use 'channelx' for the total power of all segments, if the channel bandwidth is 80 MHz and the NIWLANA_NUMBER_OF_SEGMENTS attribute is set to 2.

            Returns the minimum of 80211b peak EVM measurements. This value is expressd as a percentage.

             <summary>
            Returns the average of I/Q gain imbalance estimates across iterations.    I/Q gain imbalance is the ratio of the mean amplitude    of the in-phase (I) signal to the mean amplitude of the quadrature-phase (Q) signal. This value is expressed in dB.
                Note: If the magnitude of the carrier or the sample clock frequency offset is greater than 25 ppm,    I/Q gain imbalance magnitude is greater than 3 dB, and quadrature skew magnitude is greater than 15 degrees,    the estimates of these impairments might not be accurate. 
                Note: I/Q gain imbalance cannot be measured for signals with differential binary phase-shift keying (DBPSK) modulation.    The DBPSK modulation corresponds to a data rate of 1 Mbps. The I/Q gain imbalance measurement may fail for other modulation schemes,    for example, differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK) and 8-PSK, if there are not enough constellation    points in all quadrants of the I/Q phase plane. The DQPSK modulation corresponds to data rates of 2 Mbps, 5.5 Mbps, and 11 Mbps,    and the 8-PSK modulation corresponds to data rates of 22 Mbps and 33 Mbps.

                Note: I/Q gain imbalance cannot be measured for signals with differential binary phase-shift keying (DBPSK) modulation.    The DBPSK modulation corresponds to a data rate of 1 Mbps. The I/Q gain imbalance measurement may fail for other modulation schemes,    for example, differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK) and 8-PSK, if there are not enough constellation    points in all quadrants of the I/Q phase plane. The DQPSK modulation corresponds to data rates of 2 Mbps, 5.5 Mbps, and 11 Mbps,    and the 8-PSK modulation corresponds to data rates of 22 Mbps and 33 Mbps.

Therefore if you do not    require channel EVM measurement, you must set this attribute to NIWLANA_VAL_FALSE to improve measurement    speed. This value is expressed in your application. The    niWLANA_ConfigureFastEVM function sets this attribute to NIWLANA_VAL_FALSE. 
                The attribute is applicable only when you set the NIWLANA_STANDARD attribute to NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211N_MIMO_OFDM,     NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211AC_MIMO_OFDM, NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211AH_MIMO_OFDM, NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211AF_MIMO_OFDM, or    NIWLANA_VAL_STANDARD_80211AX_MIMO_OFDM.
                The default value is NIWLANA_VAL_TRUE.

             <summary>
             Configures multiple NI-RFSAs for Local Oscillator (LO) sharing, Reference Clock and multiple device synchronization.
             For NI 5663/5663E, NI 5665 and NI 5840 RF vector signal analyzers, this function configures LO sharing  and Reference Clock settings in daisy chained manner. 
             For NI 5644R, NI 5645R and NI 5646R RF vector signal transceiver (VST) devices, this function configures daisy-chained  LO Sharing and low-level attributes for multiple device synchronization. VSTs do not support daisy-chained Reference Clocks for synchronization. You must set the master Reference Clock source to PXI_CLK for these devices. For additional information, refer to Synchronization using NI-RFSA and NI-RFSG topic appropriate to your device in the NI RF Vector Signal Analyzers Help.
             This function assumes that the devices are interconnected in the order of elements in the instrument handles array. In time synchronization, the first device is assumed to be the master device and the remaining devices are assumed to be slave devices. The devices are divided into two sets when the number of segments are two. In LO sharing, the first device in the each set is assumed to be the master device, and the remaining devices in the set are assumed to be slave devices. To interconnect multiple devices, refer to the following topics appropriate to your device in the NI RF Vector Signal Analyzers Help:
             Interconnecting Multiple NI 5663/5663E Devices
             Using Internal and External Clock Signals with Multiple NI 5665 Devices
             Interconnecting Multiple NI 5644R RF Channels (Homogeneous Channel Types)
             Interconnecting Multiple NI 5645R RF Channels (Homogeneous Channel Types)
             Interconnecting Multiple NI 5646R RF Channels (Homogeneous Channel Types)
             Interconnecting Multiple NI 5840 RF Channels (Homogeneous Channel Types)
             If you use NI 5644R, NI 5645R or NI 5646R, the function completes the following steps:
             Sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_CLOCK_SOURCE to the value you specify in the MasterReferenceClockSource parameter.
             If you set the NIWLANA_LO_SHARING_ENABLED attribute to NIWLANA_VAL_TRUE, the function completes the following steps.
             For the master device, the function sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_EXPORT_ENABLED attribute to VI_TRUE. It also reads the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_FREQUENCY attribute so that the value can be set on slave devices. 
             For the slave devices, the function sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_SOURCE attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_LO_IN_STR and the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_FREQUENCY attribute to the value read from the master device. With the exception of the last slave device, the function also exports the LO to the next device in the daisy chain by setting the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_EXPORT_ENABLED attribute to VI_TRUE.
             Configures the trigger synchronization for the master and slave devices.
             For the master device, the function completes the following steps:
             The function sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_START_TRIGGER_MASTER attribute and the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_REF_TRIGGER_MASTER attribute to VI_TRUE. For NI 5646R it sets NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_SAMPLE_CLOCK_MASTER attribute to VI_TRUE.
             Sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_START_TRIGGER_DIST_LINE attribute and the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_REF_TRIGGER_DIST_LINE attribute to the first and second element of the TriggerLines array, respectively. For NI 5646R, it sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_SAMPLE_CLOCK_DIST_LINE attribute to the third element of the TriggerLines array.
             Calls the niRFSA_Commit function to commit the synchronization settings to the device.
             For the slave devices, the function completes the following steps:
             Sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_START_TRIGGER_MASTER attribute and NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_REF_TRIGGER_MASTER attribute to VI_FALSE. For NI 5646R, it sets NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_SAMPLE_CLOCK_MASTER attribute to VI_FALSE.
             Sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_START_TRIGGER_DIST_LINE attribute and the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_REF_TRIGGER_DIST_LINE attribute to the first and second element of the TriggerLines array, respectively. For NI 5646R, it sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_START_TRIGGER_DIST_LINE attribute to the third element of the TriggerLines array.
             Sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_TRIGGER_TYPE attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_DIGITAL_EDGE, the NIRFSA_ATTR_DIGITAL_EDGE_REF_TRIGGER_SOURCE attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_SYNC_REF_TRIGGER_STR, and the NIRFSA_ATTR_DIGITAL_EDGE_START_TRIGGER_SOURCE attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_SYNC_START_TRIGGER_STR.
             If you use NI 5663/5663E or NI 5665 RF vector signal analyzers, the function configures the devices for daisy-chained reference clock synchronization:
             For the master device, the function sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_CLOCK_SOURCE attribute to the value you specify in master Reference Clock source and the NIRFSA_ATTR_EXPORTED_REF_CLOCK_OUTPUT_TERMINAL attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_CLK_OUT_STR.
             For the slave devices, the function sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_CLOCK_SOURCE attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_CLK_IN_STR and the NIRFSA_ATTR_EXPORTED_REF_CLOCK_OUTPUT_TERMINAL attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_CLK_OUT_STR. It also sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_CLOCK_RATE attribute according to the device model.
             If NIWLANA_LO_SHARING_ENABLED attribute is set to NIWLANA_VAL_TRUE, 
             For the master device, the function exports the LO by setting the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_EXPORT_ENABLED attribute to VI_TRUE. It also reads the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_FREQUENCY attribute so that the value can be set on slave devices.
             For the slave devices, the function sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_SOURCE attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_LO_IN_STR, the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_FREQUENCY attribute to the value read from the master and exports the LO to the next device in the daisy chain by setting the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_EXPORT_ENABLED attribute to VI_TRUE.
             If you use NI 5840 RF vector signal analyzers, the function completes the following actions:
             For reference clock synchronization:
             The function configures all the devices to use PXI_CLK as reference clock if you set the NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_CLOCK_SOURCE attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_PXI_CLK_STR.
             The function configures the devices for daisy-chained reference clock synchronization, if you set the NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_CLOCK_SOURCE attribute to a value other than NIRFSA_VAL_PXI_CLK_STR.
             For the master device, the function sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_CLOCK_SOURCE attribute to the value you specify in the MasterReferenceClockSource parameter and sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_EXPORTED_REF_CLOCK_OUTPUT_TERMINAL attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_IF_COND_REF_OUT.
             For the slave devices, the function sets the  NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_CLOCK_SOURCE attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_REF_IN_STR. Except for the last slave device, this function also sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_EXPORTED_REF_CLOCK_OUTPUT_TERMINAL attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_IF_COND_REF_OUT. 
             If you set the NIWLANA_LO_SHARING_ENABLED attribute to NIWLANA_VAL_LO_SHARING_ENABLED_TRUE, the function completes the following actions: 
             For the master device, the function exports the LO by setting the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_EXPORT_ENABLED attribute to VI_TRUE. The function also reads the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_FREQUENCY attribute  so that the value can be set on slave devices. 
             For the slave devices, the function sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_SOURCE attribute to  NIRFSA_VAL_LO_IN_STR and the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_FREQUENCY attribute to the value read from the master device. Except for the last slave device, this function also exports the LO to the next device in the daisy chain by setting the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_EXPORT_ENABLED attribute to VI_TRUE.

            niWLANA_RFSAConfigureMultipleDeviceSynchronization
             int32 __stdcall niWLANA_RFSAConfigureMultipleDeviceSynchronization (niWLANA session, ViSession rfsaSessions[], int32 noOfChannels, char MasterReferenceClockSource[], int32 TriggerLines[], int32 noOfTriggerLines);
             Purpose
             Configures multiple NI-RFSAs for Local Oscillator (LO) sharing, Reference Clock and multiple device synchronization.
             For NI 5663/5663E, NI 5665 and NI 5840 RF vector signal analyzers, this function configures LO sharing  and Reference Clock settings in daisy chained manner. 
             For NI 5644R, NI 5645R and NI 5646R RF vector signal transceiver (VST) devices, this function configures daisy-chained  LO Sharing and low-level attributes for multiple device synchronization. VSTs do not support daisy-chained Reference Clocks for synchronization. You must set the master Reference Clock source to PXI_CLK for these devices. For additional information, refer to Synchronization using NI-RFSA and NI-RFSG topic appropriate to your device in the NI RF Vector Signal Analyzers Help.
             This function assumes that the devices are interconnected in the order of elements in the instrument handles array. In time synchronization, the first device is assumed to be the master device and the remaining devices are assumed to be slave devices. The devices are divided into two sets when the number of segments are two. In LO sharing, the first device in the each set is assumed to be the master device, and the remaining devices in the set are assumed to be slave devices. To interconnect multiple devices, refer to the following topics appropriate to your device in the NI RF Vector Signal Analyzers Help:
             Interconnecting Multiple NI 5663/5663E Devices
             Using Internal and External Clock Signals with Multiple NI 5665 Devices
             Interconnecting Multiple NI 5644R RF Channels (Homogeneous Channel Types)
             Interconnecting Multiple NI 5645R RF Channels (Homogeneous Channel Types)
             Interconnecting Multiple NI 5646R RF Channels (Homogeneous Channel Types)
             Interconnecting Multiple NI 5840 RF Channels (Homogeneous Channel Types)
             If you use NI 5644R, NI 5645R or NI 5646R, the function completes the following steps:
             Sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_CLOCK_SOURCE to the value you specify in the MasterReferenceClockSource parameter.
             If you set the NIWLANA_LO_SHARING_ENABLED attribute to NIWLANA_VAL_TRUE, the function completes the following steps.
             For the master device, the function sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_EXPORT_ENABLED attribute to VI_TRUE. It also reads the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_FREQUENCY attribute so that the value can be set on slave devices. 
             For the slave devices, the function sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_SOURCE attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_LO_IN_STR and the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_FREQUENCY attribute to the value read from the master device. With the exception of the last slave device, the function also exports the LO to the next device in the daisy chain by setting the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_EXPORT_ENABLED attribute to VI_TRUE.
             Configures the trigger synchronization for the master and slave devices.
             For the master device, the function completes the following steps:
             The function sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_START_TRIGGER_MASTER attribute and the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_REF_TRIGGER_MASTER attribute to VI_TRUE. For NI 5646R it sets NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_SAMPLE_CLOCK_MASTER attribute to VI_TRUE.
             Sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_START_TRIGGER_DIST_LINE attribute and the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_REF_TRIGGER_DIST_LINE attribute to the first and second element of the TriggerLines array, respectively. For NI 5646R, it sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_SAMPLE_CLOCK_DIST_LINE attribute to the third element of the TriggerLines array.
             Calls the niRFSA_Commit function to commit the synchronization settings to the device.
             For the slave devices, the function completes the following steps:
             Sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_START_TRIGGER_MASTER attribute and NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_REF_TRIGGER_MASTER attribute to VI_FALSE. For NI 5646R, it sets NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_SAMPLE_CLOCK_MASTER attribute to VI_FALSE.
             Sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_START_TRIGGER_DIST_LINE attribute and the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_REF_TRIGGER_DIST_LINE attribute to the first and second element of the TriggerLines array, respectively. For NI 5646R, it sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_SYNC_START_TRIGGER_DIST_LINE attribute to the third element of the TriggerLines array.
             Sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_TRIGGER_TYPE attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_DIGITAL_EDGE, the NIRFSA_ATTR_DIGITAL_EDGE_REF_TRIGGER_SOURCE attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_SYNC_REF_TRIGGER_STR, and the NIRFSA_ATTR_DIGITAL_EDGE_START_TRIGGER_SOURCE attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_SYNC_START_TRIGGER_STR.
             If you use NI 5663/5663E or NI 5665 RF vector signal analyzers, the function configures the devices for daisy-chained reference clock synchronization:
             For the master device, the function sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_CLOCK_SOURCE attribute to the value you specify in master Reference Clock source and the NIRFSA_ATTR_EXPORTED_REF_CLOCK_OUTPUT_TERMINAL attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_CLK_OUT_STR.
             For the slave devices, the function sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_CLOCK_SOURCE attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_CLK_IN_STR and the NIRFSA_ATTR_EXPORTED_REF_CLOCK_OUTPUT_TERMINAL attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_CLK_OUT_STR. It also sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_CLOCK_RATE attribute according to the device model.
             If NIWLANA_LO_SHARING_ENABLED attribute is set to NIWLANA_VAL_TRUE, 
             For the master device, the function exports the LO by setting the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_EXPORT_ENABLED attribute to VI_TRUE. It also reads the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_FREQUENCY attribute so that the value can be set on slave devices.
             For the slave devices, the function sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_SOURCE attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_LO_IN_STR, the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_FREQUENCY attribute to the value read from the master and exports the LO to the next device in the daisy chain by setting the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_EXPORT_ENABLED attribute to VI_TRUE.
             If you use NI 5840 RF vector signal analyzers, the function completes the following actions:
             For reference clock synchronization:
             The function configures all the devices to use PXI_CLK as reference clock if you set the NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_CLOCK_SOURCE attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_PXI_CLK_STR.
             The function configures the devices for daisy-chained reference clock synchronization, if you set the NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_CLOCK_SOURCE attribute to a value other than NIRFSA_VAL_PXI_CLK_STR.
             For the master device, the function sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_CLOCK_SOURCE attribute to the value you specify in the MasterReferenceClockSource parameter and sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_EXPORTED_REF_CLOCK_OUTPUT_TERMINAL attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_IF_COND_REF_OUT.
             For the slave devices, the function sets the  NIRFSA_ATTR_REF_CLOCK_SOURCE attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_REF_IN_STR. Except for the last slave device, this function also sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_EXPORTED_REF_CLOCK_OUTPUT_TERMINAL attribute to NIRFSA_VAL_IF_COND_REF_OUT. 
             If you set the NIWLANA_LO_SHARING_ENABLED attribute to NIWLANA_VAL_LO_SHARING_ENABLED_TRUE, the function completes the following actions: 
             For the master device, the function exports the LO by setting the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_EXPORT_ENABLED attribute to VI_TRUE. The function also reads the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_FREQUENCY attribute  so that the value can be set on slave devices. 
             For the slave devices, the function sets the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_SOURCE attribute to  NIRFSA_VAL_LO_IN_STR and the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_FREQUENCY attribute to the value read from the master device. Except for the last slave device, this function also exports the LO to the next device in the daisy chain by setting the NIRFSA_ATTR_LO_EXPORT_ENABLED attribute to VI_TRUE.

If you set the NIWLANA_DSSS_DEMOD_MAXIMUM_CHIPS_USED     attribute to &#8211;1 and the actual number of chips present in the signal is less than 1,000, NaN is returned.
                 Note: For DSSS demodulation, if equalization is not enabled and the reference pulse-shaping filter     type and filter coefficients do not match the filter    configuration of the DUT or generator, you might notice EVM degradation.     Ensure the pulse-shaping type and pulse-shaping coefficient settings match    the input signal settings.
                 Note: If the pulse-shaping filter coefficient is less than 0.2, DSSS EVM might show degradation.
                 The toolkit broadly follows section 18.4.7.8 of IEEE Standard 802.11b-1999 and section 18.4.7.8 of IEEE Standard 802.11-2007 to compute the    EVM. The standard calls for EVM computation only on the differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK) signal.    However, the toolkit computes EVM for all compulsory and optional data rates and modulation schemes defined    for IEEE Standard 802.11b-1999, as well as the extended rate physical layer-packet binary convolutional coding (ERP-PBCC) modes defined in IEEE Standard 802.11g.    Refer to the EVM Differentiation for DSSS Signals help topic for an explanation of    the difference between RMS EVM, peak EVM, 802.11b-1999 peak EVM, and 802.11-2007 peak EVM.

                Note: For DSSS demodulation, if equalization is not enabled and the reference pulse-shaping filter     type and filter coefficients do not match the filter    configuration of the DUT/generator, you might notice EVM degradation.     Ensure the pulse-shaping type and pulse-shaping coefficient settings match    the input signal settings.
                Note: If the pulse-shaping filter coefficient is less than 0.2, DSSS EVM might show degradation.
                The toolkit broadly follows section 18.4.7.8 of IEEE Standard 802.11b-1999 to compute the    root mean square (RMS) value. The standard calls for EVM computation only on the differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK) signal.    However, the toolkit computes EVM for all compulsory and optional data rates and modulation schemes defined    for IEEE Standard 802.11b-1999, as well as the extended rate physical layer-packet binary convolutional coding (ERP-PBCC) modes defined in IEEE Standard 802.11g.    Refer to the EVM Differentiation topic for an explanation of    the difference between RMS EVM, peak EVM, and 802.11b-1999 peak EVM, respectively.    Note: For DSSS demodulation, if equalization is not enabled and the reference pulse-shaping filter type and filter coefficients     do not match the filter configuration of the DUT/generator, you might notice EVM degradation.

This attribute is used    to configure NI vector signal analyzers for signal acquisition inside the niWLANA_RFSAConfigureHardware function    or the niWLANA_RFSAConfigureMIMOHardware function.    The toolkit determines this attribute using the following equation:
                Recommended Acquisition Length = Acquisition Length + Recommended Pre-Trigger Delay
                where Maximum Measurement Length is the maximum of the values of the following attributes, if the    corresponding measurement is enabled and NIWLANA_ACQUISITION_LENGTH attribute is not set.

                All of the above measurements cannot be enabled simultaneously. Refer to the Simultaneous Measurements topic for more details. 
                If you did not set any of the above attributes and the NIWLANA_ACQUISITION_LENGTH attribute is set, the maximum    measurement length equals the value of the NIWLANA_ACQUISITION_LENGTH attribute.

             char[]
             Specifies the name of the session that you are looking up or creating. If a session with the same name already exists, this function returns a reference to that session. To get the reference to an existing open session, call the niWLANG_OpenSession function and specify the same name as an existing open session function in the sessionName parameter.
              You can obtain the reference to an existing session multiple times if you have not called the niWLANG_CloseSession function in that session. You do not need to close the session multiple times. To create an unnamed session, pass an empty string to the sessionName parameter. 
             Tip  National Instruments recommends that you call the niWLANG_CloseSession function for each uniquely-named instance of the niWLANG_OpenSession function or each instance of the niWLANG_OpenSession function with an unnamed session.

            Specifies the headroom, in dB, for each transmit channel. This attribute represents the maximum peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)    allowed in the signal to be generated. The toolkit clips any portion of the signal that exceeds the peak power corresponding to this value.    The toolkit ignores this attribute if you set the NIWLANG_AUTO_HEADROOM_ENABLED attribute to NIWLANG_VAL_TRUE.
                 If you set the NIWLANG_AUTO_HEADROOM_ENABLED attribute to NIWLANG_VAL_FALSE, the toolkit uses default values based on the NIWLANG_STANDARD attribute.    If you set the NIWLANG_STANDARD attribute to NIWLANG_VAL_STANDARD_80211BG_DSSS, the default value is 5. Otherwise, the default value is 12.
                Note: If you specify a value that is more than the actual PAPR of the signal, there is loss of    dynamic range of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC). If you specify a value that is less than the actual PAPR of the signal, the toolkit clips the generated signal.
                 Note: In toolkit version 2.0.0, the NIWLANG_HEADROOM attribute was called NIWLANG_MAX_EXPECTED_PAPR. To get the same behavior of this attribute     as in version 2.0.0, you must set the NIWLANG_AUTO_HEADROOM_ENABLED attribute to NIWLANG_VAL_FALSE in version 3.0.0.
                If the NIWLANG_STANDARD attribute is set to NIWLANG_VAL_STANDARD_80211N_MIMO_OFDM, use a channelString parameter to configure this attribute. Refer to the Syntax for Channel String help topic for more information about configuring the channelString parameters.

        <member name="M:NationalInstruments.RFToolkits.Interop.niWLANG.GetHeadroom(System.String,System.Double@)">
             <summary>
            Specifies the headroom, in dB, for each transmit channel. This attribute represents the maximum peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)    allowed in the signal to be generated. The toolkit clips any portion of the signal that exceeds the peak power corresponding to this value.    The toolkit ignores this attribute if you set the NIWLANG_AUTO_HEADROOM_ENABLED attribute to NIWLANG_VAL_TRUE.
                 If you set the NIWLANG_AUTO_HEADROOM_ENABLED attribute to NIWLANG_VAL_FALSE, the toolkit uses default values based on the NIWLANG_STANDARD attribute.    If you set the NIWLANG_STANDARD attribute to NIWLANG_VAL_STANDARD_80211BG_DSSS, the default value is 5. Otherwise, the default value is 12.
                Note: If you specify a value that is more than the actual PAPR of the signal, there is loss of    dynamic range of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC). If you specify a value that is less than the actual PAPR of the signal, the toolkit clips the generated signal.
                 Note: In toolkit version 2.0.0, the NIWLANG_HEADROOM attribute was called NIWLANG_MAX_EXPECTED_PAPR. To get the same behavior of this attribute     as in version 2.0.0, you must set the NIWLANG_AUTO_HEADROOM_ENABLED attribute to NIWLANG_VAL_FALSE in version 3.0.0.
                If the NIWLANG_STANDARD attribute is set to NIWLANG_VAL_STANDARD_80211N_MIMO_OFDM, use a channelString parameter to configure this attribute. Refer to the Syntax for Channel String help topic for more information about configuring the channelString parameters.

            <param name = "carrierFrequency">
             Returns the carrier frequency. This value is expressed in Hz. The function calculates the carrier frequency using the following equation:
             carrier frequency (Hz) = channel starting frequency (Hz) + (TVHT_W * channel number + channel center frequency correction (Hz)
             where channel center frequency correction (Hz) is used to adjust the carrier frequency in the different TVHT modes. It is 0 for NIWLANG_VAL_TVHT_MODE_1 and NIWLANG_VAL_TVHT_MODE_2N, 0.5 * TVHT_W for NIWLANG_VAL_TVHT_MODE_2C and NIWLANG_VAL_TVHT_MODE_4N and 1.5 * TVHT_W for NIWLANG_VAL_TVHT_MODE_4C.

This function configures the thresholds for each resource unit (RU) size and each spatial stream of the 802.11ax DUT. You must configure this table based on the packet extension requirements of the DUT.
             The PE field of in 802.11ax signal provides additional processing time to the receiver to decode the last symbol. The possible durations of the PE field are 0 microseconds, 4 microseconds, 8 microseconds, 12 microseconds, or 16 microseconds. The PE duration is determined by both the pre-FEC padding factor of the Data field, and the maximum PE duration requested by the recipient, and the modulation scheme of the current PPDU. The maximum PE durations as defined by the HE Capabilities element are 0 microseconds, 8 microseconds and 16 microseconds, which can be specified using this function.
             The maximum PE duration is computed by comparing the constellation index and the threshold values. Packet extension device capability threshold values are defined for all RU sizes greater than or equal to 242 tones. No thresholds are defined for an RU size less than 242 tones. The supported constellations are assigned with a unique index value as shown in following table.

             PE mode 16 microseconds: PE duration is 4, 8, 12 and 16 microseconds for pre-FEC padding factor of 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively
             The maximum PE is calculated from the threshold values and the constellation index for the specified MCS index as following. 
             If the constellation is greater than or equal to PPET16, you must apply the value of the maximum PPET16 parameter, or if the constellation is greater than or equal to PPET8, you must apply the value of the maximum PPET8 parameter; otherwise, there is no packet extension.
             If no PE is required for all constellations, set PPET8 and PPET16 to "" (empty array).
             If only the max PE 8 microseconds mode is required, set PPET16 to be "" (empty array), and PPET8 to be the constellation at which max PE 8 microseconds mode starts.
             If only the max PE 16 microseconds mode is required, set PPET16 to be the constellation at which max PE 16 microseconds mode starts, and PPET8 to be "" (empty array).

             Purpose
             Configures the packet extension (PE) thresholds that determine the maximum PE duration of the 802.11ax signal. This function configures the thresholds for each resource unit (RU) size and each spatial stream of the 802.11ax DUT. You must configure this table based on the packet extension requirements of the DUT.
             The PE field of in 802.11ax signal provides additional processing time to the receiver to decode the last symbol. The possible durations of the PE field are 0 microseconds, 4 microseconds, 8 microseconds, 12 microseconds, or 16 microseconds. The PE duration is determined by both the pre-FEC padding factor of the Data field, and the maximum PE duration requested by the recipient, and the modulation scheme of the current PPDU. The maximum PE durations as defined by the HE Capabilities element are 0 microseconds, 8 microseconds and 16 microseconds, which can be specified using this function.
             The maximum PE duration is computed by comparing the constellation index and the threshold values. Packet extension device capability threshold values are defined for all RU sizes greater than or equal to 242 tones. No thresholds are defined for an RU size less than 242 tones. The supported constellations are assigned with a unique index value as shown in following table.

            Specifies a user-defined bit pattern as an array of zeros and ones.    If the array length is greater than the configured payload length, the    toolkit uses a subset of the required length from the beginning of the array    for waveform generation. If the array length is less than the configured    payload length, the user-defined bit pattern is repeated until the required    length is achieved. If the NIWLANG_PAYLOAD_DATA_TYPE attribute is set to    NIWLANG_VAL_PN_SEQUENCE, the    toolkit ignores the NIWLANG_PAYLOAD_USER_DEFINED_BITS attribute.
               Valid values include arrays    of zeros and ones.
               The default is an empty array. Valid values include arrays of zeros and ones.
